accommodation	"Hi mate.. let’s see if i can help you with that
A nice single room near the university is usually around €450/month. Remember to ask the landlord if the expenses are included in the price since they might cost you an additional  €60/month.
Ask about the deposit too and be clear about how long you will stay! Alternatively, we advise you to check the notice board of your university, where many people put their offers, and to join Facebook groups regarding rooms for rent. ESN Roma ASE has one too over https://www.facebook.com/groups/210688379572481     If you decide to go with a real estate agent be mindful that they might ask for extra money for the initial renting period. It might turn out to be more convenient to stay for a few extra days in your hostel, rather than renting through a real estate agent. If you find a house but you have doubts about the area you can ask us for advice.
